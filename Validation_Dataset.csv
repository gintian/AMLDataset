product_review_032918,"Got this because I was tired of how slow my first gen Xbox was, and for half the original price, size and heat that it gave off, I was blown away. Truly amazing how much value you get out of this. I would recommend getting external storage though as 512gb fills up fast with the size of modern games. Other than that, it is outstanding.",TRUE,5,video_games
product_review_032919,"Bought this to replace our Shield TV asain Entertainment for streaming and possibly some gaming. States its fortnite bundle containing in game. So don't buy if you think you will be getting physical promotional code to redeem ingamepromotions, same for rocket league. Issue is this doesn't come with inlay with promo code. Instead after checking with Xbox Customer Service it's built into this console and redeemed to 1st account installed on the console. Never heard of this before, I am not adding our child's account to this to mess around redeeming some built in code, never had this with the fortnite promoted Xbox One previous gen.",TRUE,1,video_games
product_review_032920,It’s great console and it isn’t for a gamer but more like for an entertainment. Only I didn’t like what coming out of the box is 364 GB free and only 4. If you are plan to buy. Please please get yourself expansion slot and one larger external hard drive or buy Xbox series x if you are gamer. Otherwise it is best for an entertainment.games that I could installing. Kind of wish they could either have 750 or 900 gb.,TRUE,4,video_games

product_review_032923,"Bought 2 of these as an extra gift for my sons. The problem is that even though they come through as 2 separate items, when you come to print the voucher out it has both codes on it. So if you are ordering them for more than one person then you will need to order one then another one etc. Other than that the process was very easy. I ha e marked them down to 3 stars because of the amount of tipexing and photocopying I had to do to get them a voucher each.",TRUE,3,video_games
product_review_032924,"This was a present for my grandson trying to redeem this gift voucher was a nightmare to get the code I was instructed to log in to Microsoft I still could not use the code as it only showed half of it, eventually after half an hour I googled how else to get the code and was able to redeem it. It is usually a case of a 5 minute job, Dissapointed.",TRUE,3,video_games
product_review_032925,"The code I received didn’t work. I got a message to contact Amazon. Not happy. Coming back to edit my review in July 2019. This code worked eventually. Not sure what the issue was, but it now has been redeemed.",TRUE,3,video_games
product_review_032926,"Cant go wrong, would be nice to get it cheaper then the full £10. I do agree with others very confusing to redeem. Last year wife redeemed so went on her account. This time I read other comments. When you get the email the code is on the email!",TRUE,3,video_games
product_review_032927,"I was concerned as some reviewers stated the voucher was credited to their own Microsoft account when following the link in the email. I looked Earlier this year I also ended up with a £25 credit when I used the email link to use the voucher. It's still sitting in my Microsoft account as I have no need for it and am not able to pass it to my son as originally intended.up the voucher code in my amazon account (also linked in the email) and let my son use it through the ""redeem' option on his Xbox.Dear Amazon, the description needs updated regarding using it as a gift. More importantly however is a review of the email content to clarify the link will allow the user to credit the money to their MS account. There should be some instructions on how to use it as a gift for someone else. Making the email more user friendly would save a lot of frustration. Thank you.",TRUE,4,video_games
product_review_032928,Okay so you’ve asked for a review Amazon. It’s an online purchase which has no human interaction however one thing that does bug me is I always find it quite difficult to locate the redemption code that is issued. It’s not immediately clear from the purchase and you have to go hunting for it. This happens every time I get one of these so for that reason I’ve only given it two stars,TRUE,2,video_games
product_review_032929,After getting code it prompted me to open Microsoft account code redeems it self in to that then can’t pass it on as a gift now got fifty £in my account that I won’t use and my grandson loses out,TRUE,2,video_games
product_review_032930,couldnt find how to redeem this product had to go on a laptop not my phone in order to do it. Would just be easier if you got a gift card sent out. In future I will just buy one from a shop.,TRUE,2,video_games
product_review_032931,"not clear what im meant to do once purchased. there if a reference number in the email, and then a seperate gift card number once ive tried to click on the link. giving this to a child as a gift, so would be good if i knew which details i was giving them",TRUE,2,video_games
product_review_032932,"THANK YOU XBOX- I have used these BRILLIANT vouchers as gifts for my nephew approx 5/ 6 times now & we both LOVE THEM!!! These vouchers are THE GREATEST INVENTION since 'Space Invaders!' at the best of times, (for those of you 'Among Us' who remember...) but especially during this crazy year of Coronavirus restrictions & everything associated with that! Buying a voucher & then simply sharing the code with him (via a text/ phone call/ email or written in a card) has allowed me to continue to be an active part of my nephews every day life, despite us living at opposite ends of the UK. The whole instant voucher concept has also meant that I have been able to make easy, personally meaningful & instant gifts across the year, including his birthday last May, gift for Christmas but also as a reward for his strength, motivation & resilience with school- splitting in to bubbles, being sent home & in to quarantine repeatedly, having actual time & opportunities with his mates restricted as well as dealing with the rest of the 'stuff' that's going on! MANY THANKS & I WILL BE BACK AGAIN (& again, & again...)",TRUE,5,video_games
product_review_032933,"This was a quick easy way for me to get Xbox credit. I receive quite a few amazon vouchers through work I do and in this instance it was cheaper to If you want a physical gift card then most supermarkets supply these.N.B. This is a digital code not a physical gift card, if this is meant as a gift you’ll need to send the code to the recipient so they can enter it.I’d recommend having the Xbox app set up too so you can copy and paste the code easily.It took a few hours for the code to come through but it worked easily.buy the games via the Microsoft store.",TRUE,5,video_games
product_review_032934,"It actually works and is not fake. All you have to do is once purchased click the button that says ‘redeem digital code’ ( I think it is says that but Then you might have to wait for the code and once the code has appeared, go onto your Xbox and go to store. Then go down to redeem a code, type in the code from your phone, click accept and it will be on your account. So when you buy something instead of selecting your credit/debit card select gift card. You can do it differently by before buying something instead of doing debit/ credit card, click redeem gift card maybe wrong)",TRUE,5,video_games
product_review_032935,"Not much to write about here, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. filters out the pop sounds. now my recordings are much more crisp. it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing,",TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032936,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]",TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032937,"The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.",TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032938,Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops. Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.,TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032939,This pop filter is great. It looks and performs like a studio filter. If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.,TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032940,"So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!",TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032941,"I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.",TRUE,5,musical_instruments
product_review_032942,I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.,TRUE,4,musical_instruments

product_review_032944,"I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!",TRUE,1,musical_instruments
product_review_032945,"If you're like me, you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PC.It works fine for the handy type recorders.But forget hooking this directly to a PC.  Way too much noise.",TRUE,4,musical_instruments
product_review_032946,"I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it. I needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera...The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...I'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.Also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic).",TRUE,2,musical_instruments
product_review_032947,"It is a decent cable. It does its job, but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned. The mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth. The switch is also loose. The connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed.'I would not recommend using this cable for critical applications. It would be more suited to home or hobby use.",TRUE,3,musical_instruments
product_review_032948,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too, but it is very flammable. I would call it average.",TRUE,3,musical_instruments
product_review_032949,"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""For all but the tone snobs,"" a review further down on this product's page:""Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat ""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.""I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a ""big amp"" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.",TRUE,2,musical_instruments
product_review_032950,"Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.",TRUE,1,musical_instruments
product_review_032951,"This is a little more expensive than some other brands, but i think it sounds great and it's way more durable than a plastic pedal.I'm pretty new to electric guitar so i'm not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers.  To me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp, so I think it's a good purchase.",TRUE,4,musical_instruments
